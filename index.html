                <p class="program">I have recently started my IT journey in Birendra Multiple Campus. My subject of choice is CSIT, and it is in this course that I got introduced to C-Programming.It has only been a month since I started studying this subject, so I can be categorised as a novice in this field.But, if you'd still like to collab, I'm here for you</p>

                <p class="webdev">Yeah, yeah I know I know that 'chillies' logo doesn't fit into the topic at all, but that's life, mate. You can not always make things perfect,but that's okay because sometimes the imperfection is what looks good, and also the internet was down, so I couldn't download any photos,but when the internet will be there I would probably just be too lazy to change these two lines of code.So, getting into the real topic, I am an intermediate in web develoment. If you want someone to be baffled at complex questions with, I might just be the right guy for you.</p>
